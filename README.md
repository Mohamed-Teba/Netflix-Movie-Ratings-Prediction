# 🎬 Netflix Movie Ratings Prediction 🍿

Welcome to the **Netflix Movie Ratings Prediction** project! 🚀 This repository is dedicated to building a machine learning system to predict movie ratings on Netflix, helping users discover films they'll love. While the repository is currently under development, it will soon house a robust solution using advanced data science techniques. Stay tuned for exciting updates! 🌟

---

## 🌟 Overview

Predicting movie ratings is a game-changer in the world of streaming! 📺 This project aims to create a model that predicts how users might rate movies on Netflix based on features like genres, user preferences, and historical ratings. By leveraging machine learning, we’ll help enhance the Netflix recommendation experience! 🎯

*(Note: The repository is currently empty, but this README outlines the planned structure and goals.)*
